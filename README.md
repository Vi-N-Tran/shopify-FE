# About
This is the Front end challenge for Shopify's FE internship. The idea was to create a platform that shows images of stars (pictures taken from NASA api). I also made the BE to fit with the FE but I did not connect them due to the fact that they are different job challenges. However, I would love to do that later on!

Due to the different job openings, The FE and BE are currently running independently!
